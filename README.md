# ðŸ§® Matrix Methods for Engineering

A collection of **homework notebooks** and **personal projects** exploring matrix-based computational techniques in engineering analysis.  
This repository combines coursework from the *Matrix Methods for Engineers* curriculum with independent explorations of linear algebra applications in structural and mechanical systems.

## ðŸ§  Topics & Concepts

- Linear systems and Gaussian elimination  
- LU / QR / SVD matrix factorizations  
- Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and modal analysis  
- Finite element modeling (e.g., planar truss analysis)  
- Numerical conditioning and error propagation  
- Practical engineering applications of linear algebra  

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Environment

Developed in **Julia** using **Jupyter Notebooks** (`IJulia` kernel).

**Core Julia Packages**
- `LinearAlgebra` â€” core matrix operations and factorizations  
- `Statistics` â€” basic statistical tools  
- `Plots` â€” visualization and plotting  
- `DataFrames` â€” structured data handling  
- `DelimitedFiles` â€” CSV and text file I/O  

**Recommended Environment Setup**
```bash
# Install Julia (https://julialang.org/downloads/)
# Then in the Julia REPL:
using Pkg
Pkg.add(["IJulia", "LinearAlgebra", "Statistics", "Plots", "DataFrames", "DelimitedFiles"])
